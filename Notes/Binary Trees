Binary Tree:
  Every node has two children
 
  Maximum number of nodes at a given level l = 2 * 2 ^(l-1)
  
  For a given height h number of nodes = ( 2 ^ h ) - 1
  
  Mininum height for N nodes is log 2 (N+1)
  
Fun fact:
  
  Number of leaf nodes is greater than nodes with two children
  
Types:

  Full ( all have 0 or 2 children )
  Balanced( AVL is important , Red -Black Trees ) 
  Perfect binary tree ( all have two children )
  Degenerate Tree ( similar to linked list )
  
  
Applications:

AVL -- when binary tree is skewed it  the search space is no longer smaller ,  so AVL trees are used to balance it
